Object of the game:  To get 31 points or as to it as possible.  Must be same suit.

Rules: 
Before play begins, all players put one coin into the pot.
The dealer deals three cards to each person, and turns one face up in the middle of the table.
The player to the dealer's left goes first.
On each turn, a player may take the upturned card or the top card from the deck (they are now holding four cards).
They will choose one card to discard from their hand (face up) and play will pass clockwise to the next player.

Players take turns until one player is satisfied that the card values they hold
will likely beat the other players. A player indicates this by "knocking" on the table.
All other players then get one more turn to exchange cards. Then there is a showdown
in which the players reveal their hands and compare values.
The player with the highest total value of cards of the same suit wins the pot.

If there is a tie for the highest score, the player with the highest-ranking card wins the whole pot.
Example: K, Q, 6 (total 26) would beat Q, 9, 7 (also total 26).
If there is a tie in the highest cards, the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

Any time a player holds exactly 31, they may "knock" immediately, and they win the pot.

After the pot has been won, all the players put in chips for the next hand.
If a player is out of coins, they are on mercy.  If they loose again, they are out of the game.
Continue until only one player remains.
