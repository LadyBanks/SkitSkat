			<p><strong>Object of the Game:</strong>
				<br>
				<br>Get 31 points or as close to it as possible.
				<br>Aces are worth 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points, and everything else is face value.
				<br>Cards must be of the same suit to count towards your total.
				<br>Example: If you hold the ace of spades, the 7 of spades, and the king of hearts, you have 18 points.
				<br><br>
				<strong>How to Play:</strong>
				<br>
				<br>Before play begins, all players are given three coins.
				The dealer deals three cards to each person, and turns one face up in the middle of the table.
				The player to the dealer's left goes first.
				<br>
				<br>On each turn, a player may take the upturned card or the top card from the deck (they are now holding four cards).
				They will choose one card to discard from their hand (face up) and play will pass clockwise to the next player.
				<br>
				<br>Players take turns until one player is satisfied that the value of their hand 
				will likely be higher than the other players'. The player indicates this by "knocking" on the table when their turn begins.  They do not pick up a new card after knocking.  Play passes to the next player.
				The other players then get one more turn. Then there is a showdown
				in which the players simultaneously reveal their hands and compare values.
				The player with the highest total value of cards (of the same suit) wins, and the player with the lowest hand value must put a coin into the pot (if there is a tie for lowest score, compare who has the highest-ranking card, and if that is the same then both players must put in).  
				<br>
				<br>If there is a tie, the player with the highest-ranking card wins.
				Example: K, Q, 6 (total 26) would beat Q, 9, 7 (also total 26).
				If there is a tie in the highest cards, the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
				<br>
				<br>Any time a player holds exactly 31, they call "Skit Skat" immediately, and all other players must put in a coin.
				<br>
				<br>
				If a player is out of coins, they are on mercy.  If they loose again, they are out of the game.
				Continue until only one player remains.  The last remaining player wins all of the coins!</p>
